This is video demonstration of how to use a wifi controlled robot

-> I have assembled the robot which contains an ultra sonic sensor, two dc motors, L298N 2A Motor driver module, two wheels, NodeMCU ESP8266, 6V Battery holder and jumper wires.

-> after assembling them i have created an app on MIT App inventor to control the movement of the robot

-> i have wirtten a code so that the node mcu proceeds the way it should i.e, controls given through mobile
